# Financial-Management-Analytics

This project analyzes financial performance and operational efficiency using statistical methods, clustering techniques, and multiple machine learning regression models. The goal is to understand cost structures, transparency levels, risk profiles, and efficiency metrics across organizations.

## Key Features

### Financial performance metrics:
- Net Income, Operating Margin, Cost-to-Revenue Ratio, Operational Cost Efficiency

- K-Means Clustering to segment organizations by transparency and risk tolerance

- Regression Modeling for predicting cost efficiency using:

- Linear Regression

- Polynomial Regression

- Decision Tree

- Random Forest

- Gradient Boosting

- AdaBoost

- Bagging Regressor

- Exploratory data analysis, correlations, and visualization

## Tools & Technologies

- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Results

Models achieved high predictive performance, with several regressors reaching R² > 0.98, demonstrating strong capability to explain financial efficiency patterns
